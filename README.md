# NOTE TAKER

## Description

This application was built with provided front end code and need backend code to make it usable. The motivation was to allow the user to be able to make and delete notes for whatever they desired. I built this project because the app is vital to the users needs to write and save notes to be able to organize thoughts and keep on task ith day to day assignments and activities. It solves an issue of many people being disorganized or their organization methods being unreliable. I learned that while combining front-end and back-end creates a well made app with endless possibilities. 


## Installation

To install my application, I needed node.js to install a unique id dependency, as well as anything else in node to create a relationship between the front and back end products. Since the front end was given, after developing a working back-end and connection to the json file, I tested the application in my browser. Once that all seemed to work within the guidelines, I worked on deployed the application to Heroku.
